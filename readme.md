## Intro

This little project is built using Laravel 5.7, Bootstrap, and Fontawesome (for the icons)
The layout is two columns. On the left side you can create a Todo and it will be placed into
the left columns list. The right column is for todo's which have been marked compelted.
A user can return a completed task back to the todo list. Each icon displays a tooltip when
you hover over it. Session flash messages are also displayed and notify the user of their actions.
